// Dynamic Typing:
//in java we have,variables have data types, values have data types, once the variable is assigned a value, then it can not be changed.
// In javascript, variables have no types, values have types, once variable is assigned with one value, we can change the value by re-assigning the new value which is called dynamic typing.

//javascript objects are written within the curly braces i.e { // code falls here}.
// objects properties are written with name value pair
// for example:
 obj={
    name:'Bir',
    surname:'Tajpuriya',
    age:'21'
}

// in order to access the properties of obj variables, 
console.log(obj.name);
console.log('age of mine is: '+obj.age);
